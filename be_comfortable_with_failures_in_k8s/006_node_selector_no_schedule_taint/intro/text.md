# Introduction

In this scenario, you will troubleshoot a Kubernetes pod that fails to schedule due to a node taint preventing scheduling.

## What You'll Learn:
- How `nodeSelector` influences pod scheduling.
- How node taints work and how they affect scheduling.
- How to modify taints and tolerations to allow successful scheduling.

A pod is defined in `pod.yaml` with a `nodeSelector` targeting `node01`, but `node01` has a `NoSchedule` taint applied. Your goal is to identify the problem and fix it so the pod can be scheduled successfully.
